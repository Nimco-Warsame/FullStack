        <p><b>Wow!</b></p>

        <p>
            A BIG political moment.
        </p>
        <p>
            For something that wasn't even technically a Budget, it was one heck of a statement of intent from the new prime minister and new chancellor.
        </p>
        <p>
            And it is a gamble
        </p>
        <p>
           A massive leap in a new direction. 
        </p>   
        <p>
            It amounts to the wholesale shredding of previous economic policy: both the ones adopted by Conservative governments over the last 12 years (which Liz Truss sat within for most of that time) and those of Labour before that.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is an all-or-nothing strategy, where the prime minister will own the consequences, good or bad.
        </p>
        <p>
            Economic growth is the prize they seek. 
        </p>    
        <p>
            But they can't be certain their approach will work, nor the methods they have chosen to deliver it will be popular. 
        </p>
        <p>And then there are the side effects. </p>
