        <a href="https://www.educative.io/blog/best-first-programming-language" target="_blank">Programming</a> is a profession that uses a deep roster of languages, database models, frameworks, and much more. In addition, different classifications exist within these tools, such as high-level and low-level programming languages. With all the technologies and types out there, it can be challenging for a student to decipher not only what to be learning, but also <b>how to be learning.</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        Many people gain their programming education through universities and leave with a shiny piece of paper vouching for their skills. Despite what tradition may imply, college is not the right path for many developing programmers, <b>and the industry knows it.</b> Factors such as expenses, responsibilities, and other obstacles that appear in all of our lives can put college out of reach for some people. Add to that the recent explosion in online learners and resources, and many hiring managers have recognized that college is not the end-all-be-all it is advertised as.

        If you can learn to code well (and can prove it), you can become a programmer with any educational background! Today, we’ll help demystify this kind of <a href="https://www.educative.io/blog/project-management-tips-for-self-taught-devs" target="_blank">self-taught journey</a>
         by going in-depth about why such a goal is attainable, various learning options, and strategies to prove programming skills.

    <h2 id="you">You can do it!</h2>

    <p>
        Before you can successfully learn programming outside of the university environment, it is critical that you understand that <b>your goal is immensely attainable.</b> As mentioned in our <a href="https://www.educative.io/blog/stackoverflow-dev-survey-key-takeaways-learners#education" target="_blank"> takeaways from the 2022 Stack Overflow survey</a>, around 23% of professional developers in 2022 are working without a degree. The number of students learning to program with online resources is increasing every year, and so is the number of new industry professionals with no bachelor’s degree.
    </p>
    <p>
        Not only do you have the ability to learn everything you need to become a professional developer with online resources and platforms, but you also have a real <b>opportunity to pursue employment with whatever</b> educational background you may have. Programming is an occupation where constant learning and growth is a shared trait between the most senior and newest employees. A degree is not a prevailing indication that all knowledge has been obtained. No matter what degree you hold, you will be a student for the rest of your career in order to keep up with the unpredictable industry of technology.
    </p>
    <h3 id="why">Why a computer science degree is not the right choice for everybody</h3>
    <p>
        Since every programmer is inherently a learner, the most expensive and time-consuming learning option is not necessarily the optimal option for every future programmer out there. University tuition in the United States has been on the rise[1] for the past few decades, with no sign of slowing down.
    </p>
    <p>
        Even with available scholarships and loans, pursuing a traditional bachelor’s degree (let alone a more advanced degree) is a costly and debt-inducing venture for a lot of students. If budgeting for a bachelor’s degree is not feasible for you at this time, there is no need to feel hopeless as you can learn the exact same material and skills via different paths. A truly great gift of our internet age is that information and education are no longer reserved for the select few who can pay hefty tuition fees.
    </p>
    <p>
        The common university environment is also not the ideal situation for every learner. Suppose you’re reskilling from another profession, learning part-time with family obligations, or need to work part-time while learning to become a programmer. In that case, the rigorous curriculum of a college course isn’t necessarily the best choice. The flexibility to learn at your own pace (at a fraction of the cost) while being able to focus on the other essential tasks is a huge upside to individual learning.
    </p>
    <p>
        Many capable people don’t thrive in the traditional educational environment of a single instructor assigning tests, materials, and assignments. Rather than compete for the individual attention of the professor against an army of confused peers, many people find it much easier to be in charge of how they’re learning. Online learning provides a great option for eager students who have always felt more comfortable learning outside of the classroom setting.
    </p>
    <p>
        Beyond all the personal reasons why college may not be the perfect learning option for you, it is key to remember that you don’t need to force the university system to work for you if it isn’t working, or won’t work for you. There are other viable roads to achieving the education you desire that operate at your own speed. Even better, programmers are learning and getting hired every day from these alternate educational platforms!
